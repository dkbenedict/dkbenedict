### I'm Delaney Benedict

- I recently graduated from Cornell University this past May! 
- I majored in Information Science, concentrating in Data Science (I wanted to be a coder) 
- R is my favorite programming language
- I'm currently in the search for my "big girl job" (hire me I'm a quick learner I promise)
- I want to hone my skills and make them vast so I can wrangle the craziest datasets and 
  optimize each analysis 
- Fun fact: I competed 4 years as a student-athlete on Conrell's track and field team, becoming captian 
      my senior year!
