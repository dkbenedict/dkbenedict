- R is my favorite programming language!! then i'd say SQL
- I'm currently in the search for my "big girl job" (hire me i'm a quick learner i promise)
- I want to hone my skills and make them vast so I can wrangle the craziest datasets and 
  optimize each analysis 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I competed 4 years as a student-athlete on Conrell's track and feild team, becoming captian 
      my senior year!
